#  Supreme Court Amicus Briefs in LaTeX

This project [adapts this Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/legal-briefs-and-automatic-legal-citations-with-lawtex/mftmdfccfnyr), in turn based on LawTeX, to the page and formatting requirements of hte United States Supreme Court, and makes use of XeLaTeX rather than the older PDFLaTeX.
